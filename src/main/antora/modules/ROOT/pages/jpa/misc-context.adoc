= Using `JpaContext` in Custom Implementations

When working with multiple `EntityManager` instances and <<repositories.custom-implementations,custom repository implementations>>, you need to wire the correct `EntityManager` into the repository implementation class. You can do so by explicitly naming the `EntityManager` in the `@PersistenceContext` annotation or, if the `EntityManager` is `@Autowired`, by using `@Qualifier`.

As of Spring Data JPA 1.9, Spring Data JPA includes a class called `JpaContext` that lets you obtain the `EntityManager` by managed domain class, assuming it is managed by only one of the `EntityManager` instances in the application. The following example shows how to use `JpaContext` in a custom repository:

.Using `JpaContext` in a custom repository implementation
====
[source, java]
----
class UserRepositoryImpl implements UserRepositoryCustom {

  private final EntityManager em;

  @Autowired
  public UserRepositoryImpl(JpaContext context) {
    this.em = context.getEntityManagerByManagedType(User.class);
  }

  â€¦
}
----
====

The advantage of this approach is that, if the domain type gets assigned to a different persistence unit, the repository does not have to be touched to alter the reference to the persistence unit.
