[[jpa.auditing]]
= JPA Auditing

Spring Data JPA provides auditing based upon the foundation provided by {spring-data-commons-docs-url}/auditing.html[Spring Data Common's Auditing support].


There is also a convenience base class, `AbstractAuditable`, which you can extend to avoid the need to manually implement the interface methods. Doing so increases the coupling of your domain classes to Spring Data, which might be something you want to avoid. Usually, the annotation-based way of defining auditing metadata is preferred as it is less invasive and more flexible.


[[jpa.auditing.configuration]]
== General Auditing Configuration

Spring Data JPA ships with an entity listener that can be used to trigger the capturing of auditing information. First, you must register the `AuditingEntityListener` to be used for all entities in your persistence contexts inside your `orm.xml` file, as shown in the following example:

.Auditing configuration orm.xml
====
[source, xml]
----
<persistence-unit-metadata>
  <persistence-unit-defaults>
    <entity-listeners>
      <entity-listener class="â€¦.data.jpa.domain.support.AuditingEntityListener" />
    </entity-listeners>
  </persistence-unit-defaults>
</persistence-unit-metadata>
----
====

You can also enable the `AuditingEntityListener` on a per-entity basis by using the `@EntityListeners` annotation, as follows:

====
[source, java]
----
@Entity
@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class)
public class MyEntity {

}
----
====

NOTE: The auditing feature requires `spring-aspects.jar` to be on the classpath.

With `orm.xml` suitably modified and `spring-aspects.jar` on the classpath, activating auditing functionality is a matter of adding the Spring Data JPA `auditing` namespace element to your configuration, as follows:

.Activating auditing using XML configuration
====
[source, xml]
----
<jpa:auditing auditor-aware-ref="yourAuditorAwareBean" />
----
====

As of Spring Data JPA 1.5, you can enable auditing by annotating a configuration class with the `@EnableJpaAuditing` annotation. You must still modify the `orm.xml` file and have `spring-aspects.jar` on the classpath. The following example shows how to use the `@EnableJpaAuditing` annotation:

.Activating auditing with Java configuration
====
[source, java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableJpaAuditing
class Config {

  @Bean
  public AuditorAware<AuditableUser> auditorProvider() {
    return new AuditorAwareImpl();
  }
}
----
====

If you expose a bean of type `AuditorAware` to the `ApplicationContext`, the auditing infrastructure automatically picks it up and uses it to determine the current user to be set on domain types. If you have multiple implementations registered in the `ApplicationContext`, you can select the one to be used by explicitly setting the `auditorAwareRef` attribute of `@EnableJpaAuditing`.
